**Q**: What is this "Penetration Testing Execution Standard"?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**A**: It is a new standard designed to provide both businesses and
security service providers with a common language and scope for
performing penetration testing (i.e. Security evaluations). It started
early in 2009 following a discussion that sparked between some of the
founding members over the value (or lack of) of penetration testing in
the industry.

**Q**: Who is involved with this standard?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**A**: We are a group of information security practitioners from all
areas of the industry (I.e. Financial Institutions, Service Providers,
Security Vendors). The group currently consists of:

**Q**: So is this a closed group or can I join in?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**A**: We started this with about 6 people, the first in-person meeting
held almost 20. We would love more insight and down-to-earth opinions so
if you can contribute please feel free to email us.

**Q**: Is this going to be a formal standard?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**A**: We are aiming to create an actual standard so that businesses can
have a baseline of what is needed when they get a pentest as well as an
understanding of what type of testing they require or would provide
value to their business. The lack of standardization now is only hurting
the industry as businesses are getting low-quality work done, and
practitioners lack guidance in terms of what is needed to provide
quality service.

**Q**: Is the standard going to include all possible pentest scenarios?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**A**: While we can't possibly cover all scenarios, the standard is
going to define a baseline for the minimum that is required from a basic
pentest, as well as several "levels" on top of it that provide more
comprehensive activities required for organizations with higher security
needs. The different levels would also be defined as per the industry in
which they should be the baseline for.

**Q**: Is this effort going to standardize the reporting as well?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**A**: Yes. We feel that providing a standard for the test without
defining how the report is provided would be useless. We will define
both executive (business) reporting as well as technical reporting as an
integrated part of the standard.

**Q**: Who is the intended audience for this standard/project?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**A**: Two main communities: businesses that require the service, and
service providers. For businesses the goal is to enable them to demand a
specific baseline of work as part of a pentest. For service providers
the goal is to provide a baseline for the kinds of activities needed,
what should be taken into account as part of the pentest from scoping
through reporting and deliverables.

**Q**: Is there a mindmap version of the original sections?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**A**: Following popular demand, we have \_a\_ version of the mindmap
used when creating the first drafts of the standard available for
download
`here <http://iamit.org/docs/Penetration_Testing_Execution_Standard.mm>`__
(in FreeMind format).
