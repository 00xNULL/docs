pentest-standard.org docs redesign

## Why?

The [pentest-standard.org](http://pentest-standard.org) site is pretty great, but it's a little dated, and the way in which to make contributions is murky. This repo is an effort to redesign the site around GitHub and [Read The Docs](https://readthedocs.org/).

## Is this official?

No. This is currently an unofficial fork for the sole purpose of showing what the site could look like in this new format.

Hopefully the project members will like it.
