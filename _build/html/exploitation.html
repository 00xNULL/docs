  <div class="section" id="purpose">
<h1>Purpose<a class="headerlink" href="#purpose" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>The exploitation phase of a penetration test focuses solely on
establishing access to a system or resource by bypassing security
restrictions. If the prior phase, vulnerability analysis was performed
properly, this phase should be well planned and a precision strike.. The
main focus is to identify the main entry point into the organization and
to identify high value target assets.</p>
<p>If the vulnerability analysis phase was properly completed, a high value
target list should have been complied. Ultimately the attack vector
should take into consideration the success probability and highest
impact on the organization.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="countermeasures">
<h1>Countermeasures<a class="headerlink" href="#countermeasures" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Countermeasures are defined as preventative technology or controls that
hinder the ability to successfully complete an exploit avenue. This
technology could be a Host Based Intrusion Prevention System, Security
Guard, Web Application Firewall, or other preventative methods. When
performing an exploit, several factors should be taken into
consideration. In the event of a preventative technology, a
circumvention technique should be considered. In circumstances when this
is not possible, alternative exploit methods should be considered.</p>
<p>Overall, the purpose is to remain stealth when attacking the
organization, if alarms are tripped the level of the assessment could be
diminished. If at all possible, the countermeasures should be enumerated
prior to triggering the exploit. This could be done through doing dry
runs of the attack or enumerating the technology.</p>
<div class="section" id="anti-virus">
<h2>Anti-Virus<a class="headerlink" href="#anti-virus" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Anti-virus is a technology aimed at preventing malicious software from
being deployed on the system. As a penetration tester we should be able
to identify these types of anti-virus technologies and be able to
protect against them. Anti-virus is a small subset of all of the
different preventative measures that can be in place, for example
host-based intrusion prevention systems, web application firewalls, and
other preventative technologies.</p>
<div class="section" id="encoding">
<h3>Encoding<a class="headerlink" href="#encoding" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Encoding is the method of obfuscating data in a way that makes the
deployed piece of code not appear the same. With encoding, the
obfuscation occurs usually by scrambling the information and
re-arranging in order to hide the fact of what the application is
actually doing.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="packing">
<h3>Packing<a class="headerlink" href="#packing" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Packing is similar to encoding in a sense in that it attempts to
re-arrange data to compress the application or &#8220;pack&#8221; it. The hopes of
this is that the executable or piece of code being delivered is
obfuscated in a manner that it won&#8217;t be picked up by anti-virus
technologies.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="encrypting">
<h3>Encrypting<a class="headerlink" href="#encrypting" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Encrypting, like Encoding and Packing is another method of manipulating
the intended runnable code such that it is not recognizable or available
for inspection. Only after decrypting in in-memory (with methods similar
to packing) the actual code is exposed for the first time - hopefully
after security mechanisms have allowed it through and it is executed
immediately after it is decrypted.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="whitelist-bypass">
<h3>Whitelist Bypass<a class="headerlink" href="#whitelist-bypass" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Whitelisting technologies leveraged a trusted model for applications
that have been seen on a given system at a time. The technology takes a
baseline of the system and identifies what is normal to be run on the
system versus what is something foreign. The penetration tester should
be able to circumvent whitelist technologies. One of the most common
methods is through direct memory access. Whitelisting does not have the
capbility of monitoring memory real time and if a memory resident
program is running and not touching disk, it can run without being
detect by the given technology.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="process-injection">
<h3>Process Injection<a class="headerlink" href="#process-injection" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Process injection is simply the method to inject into an already running
process. By injecting into a process, the information of the application
can be hidden within a process that would normally be trusted in nature.
It&#8217;s very difficult for preventative measure technology to inspect
running processes and can almost always hide in a different process that
the application would think is a trusted one.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="purely-memory-resident">
<h3>Purely Memory Resident<a class="headerlink" href="#purely-memory-resident" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Memory resident attacks are generally the most preferred as most
technologies do not inspect memory. As an attacker, finding a way to
live in memory purely would be most desirable. When writing to disk,
most applications will conduct scans, baselines, and other
identifications of potentially maliicous software. The ability to be
detected when writing to disk becomes significantly greater.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="human">
<h2>Human<a class="headerlink" href="#human" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>When performing exploitation, it is not always the best route to go
through a direct exploit or through an application flaw. Sometimes the
human element may be a better way to attack an organization. It&#8217;s
important to understand the right attack avenue and make sure that the
method we are leveraging is the best route to take.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="data-execution-prevention-dep">
<h2>Data Execution Prevention (DEP)<a class="headerlink" href="#data-execution-prevention-dep" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>When performing exploitation, many preventative measures canc ome into
play. Data Execution Prevention is a defensive measure implemented into
most operating systems and prevents execute permission when an overwrite
in memory has occurred. The thought process behind DEP is to stop an
attacker in rewriting memory and then executing that code. There are
mulitple methods to bypass data execution prevention and discussed later
in the the exploitation phase of PTES.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="address-space-layout-randomization">
<h2>Address Space Layout Randomization<a class="headerlink" href="#address-space-layout-randomization" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>During a buffer overflow vulnerability (or that of anything where we
control memory), memory addresses are hardcoded in order redirect
execution flow to our shellcode. In the event of ASLR, certain bytes are
randomized in order to prevent an attacker from predicting where he/she
can always go to in order to execute shellcode.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="web-application-firewall-waf">
<h2>Web Application Firewall (WAF)<a class="headerlink" href="#web-application-firewall-waf" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Web application firewalls are a technology that sits inline with an
application in order to protect against web-based application attacks.
Web application firewalls attempt to identify potentially dangerous or
malforms attacked towards a given web applciation and prevent them.
There are a number of bypass techniques for web application firewalls
and should be tested during the penetration test.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="evasion">
<h1>Evasion<a class="headerlink" href="#evasion" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Evasion is the technique used in order to escape detection during a
penetration test. This could be circumventing a camera system as to not
be seen by a guard, obfuscating your payloads to evade Intrusion
Detection Systems (IDS) or Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) or
encoding requests/responses to circumvent web application firewalls.
Overall, the need to identify a low risk scenario for evading a
technology or person should be formulated prior to the exploit.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="precision-strike">
<h1>Precision Strike<a class="headerlink" href="#precision-strike" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>The main focus of a penetration test is to simulate an attacker in order
to represent a simulated attack against the organization. The value
brought through a penetration test is generally not through smash and
grab techniques where the attacks are noisy in nature and in an attempt
to try every exploit. This approach may be particularly useful at the
end of a penetration test to gauge the level of incident response from
the organization, but in most cases the exploitation phase is a
accumulation of specific research on the target.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="customized-exploitation-avenue">
<h1>Customized Exploitation Avenue<a class="headerlink" href="#customized-exploitation-avenue" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Every attack will typically not be the same in how the exploitation
avenue occurs. In order to be successful in this phase, the attack
should be tailored and customized based on the scenario. For example, if
a wireless penetration test is occurred, and a specific technology is in
use, these need to be identified and attacked based on what technologies
are in place. Having a clear understanding of each scenario and the
applicability of an exploit is one of the most important aspects of this
phase of the penetration test.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="tailored-exploits">
<h1>Tailored Exploits<a class="headerlink" href="#tailored-exploits" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>In a number of occasions the exploits that are public on the Internet
may need some work in order to successfully complete. In most cases, if
an exploit is designed for Windows XP SP2, specific modifications to the
exploit will be required in order for the attack to be successful via
Windows XP SP3. The penetration tester should have the knowledge in
place to be able to customize an exploit and the ability to change on
the fly in order to successfully complete the attack.</p>
<div class="section" id="exploit-customization">
<h2>Exploit Customization<a class="headerlink" href="#exploit-customization" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In the event of an attack, it is often required to simulate the victims
infrastructure in order to ensure that the exploitation phase will be
successful. The techniques leveraged in the information gathering phase
can always help assist in that however, having a working infrastructure
and systems in place will make the expliotation phase much easier. In
the event of a tailored exploit, the penetration tester should be able
to customize already public exploits in order to successfully attack a
system. A common theme for exploits is to target specific versions of
operating systems or applications. The reason for this is due to memory
addresses changing based on service packs, and/or new versions of the
operating system. The tester should be able to customize these exploits
to successfully deploy to different operating systems and successfully
compromise the system.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="zero-day-angle">
<h1>Zero-Day Angle<a class="headerlink" href="#zero-day-angle" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>In most cases, the zero-day angle is often a last resort for most
penetration testers. This type of attack often represents a highly
advanced organization that can handle a focused attack against the
organization through normal attack methods. In certain scenarios
research may be conducted in order to reverse engineer, fuzz, or perform
advanced discovery of vulnerabilities that have not been discovered. In
the event this type of attack is applicable, ensure that the environment
to the best of the attackers knowledge is reproduced to include
countermeasure technology.</p>
<p>In order for zero-day exploits to be successful (or any exploit for that
matter), having the same operating system, patches, and countermeasures
is highly important on success. Sometimes this information may not be
available based on the level of access or enumeration that has occurred.</p>
<div class="section" id="fuzzing">
<h2>Fuzzing<a class="headerlink" href="#fuzzing" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Fuzzing is the ability to recreate a protocol or application and attempt
to send data at the application in hopes of identification of a
vulnerability. Often times the hopes of a fuzzer is to identify a crash
in an application and craft a specific exploit out of it. In the case of
fuzzing, the attacker is attempting to create a specific vulnerability
out of something that hasn&#8217;t been discovered before. As part of a
penetration test, if no avenues are identified during the engagement, or
the engagement calls for zero-day research; fuzzing techniques should be
leveraged in order to identify potentially vulnerable exposures.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="source-code-analysis">
<h2>Source Code Analysis<a class="headerlink" href="#source-code-analysis" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Other avenues that a penetration tester has available is if the source
code is available or open-source. If the tester has the ability to look
at the source code and identify flaws within the application, zero day
exposures can also be identified through these methods.</p>

<h2>Types of Exploits<a class="headerlink" href="#types-of-exploits" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>There are several types of exploits that can be identified during a
penetration test that could be classified as a zero-day. Some are listed
in this section.</p>
<div class="section" id="buffer-overflows">
<h3>Buffer Overflows<a class="headerlink" href="#buffer-overflows" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Buffer overflows occur due to improper coding techniques. Specifically
this usually occurs when a program writes data to a buffer and then
overruns the buffer&#8217;s boundary and begins to overwrite portions of
memory. In buffer overflow exploits the attackers goal is to control a
crash and gain code execution on the given system. In a buffer overflow
exploit, one of the more common techniques is to overwrite a given
register and &#8220;jump&#8221; to the shellcode.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="seh-overwrites">
<h3>SEH Overwrites<a class="headerlink" href="#seh-overwrites" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>SEH overwrites occur when the structured exception handler begins to
gracefully close an application. The attacker can manipulate how SEH
works, overwrite the base address of the SEH handler and gain control of
execution flow through the SEH. This is a common attack leveraged with
buffer overflow vulnerability and applications that have been complied
with SEH.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="return-oriented-programming">
<h3>Return Oriented Programming<a class="headerlink" href="#return-oriented-programming" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Return Oriented Programming (ROP) is a technique used during a portion
where the user has control of execution flow however data execution
prevention (DEP) or other precluding defense mechanisms may be in place.
In the situation where DEP is enabled, the attacker does not have direct
access to execute specific assembly instructions, therefor the attacker
buildsa ROP gadget in order to prep certain Windows API calls or
techniques to disable DEP or circumvent DEP. A common method is
leveraging the WriteProcessMemory call to copy data from the stack into
a writable memory space that can then be executed.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="traffic-analysis">
<h2>Traffic Analysis<a class="headerlink" href="#traffic-analysis" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Traffic analysis is the technique of identifying what type of
information is being sent and the ability to understand and manipulate
that traffic. A penetration tester should be able to understand how a
protocol works and how it can be manipulated in order to leverage an
attack.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="physical-access">
<h2>Physical Access<a class="headerlink" href="#physical-access" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Physical access during a penetration test can be a viable attack method
for attempting to circumvent physical security controls and gain
unauthorized access. During a penetration test, the assessor should be
able to identify potentially flawed physical security controls and
attempt to gain access to the facility if within scope.</p>
<div class="section" id="human-angle">
<h3>Human Angle<a class="headerlink" href="#human-angle" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>During a physical penetration test, some of the most obvious ways would
be to social-engineer your way into the facility and gain access. This
requires significant knowledge of how the organization performs
business, and everything you learned from the intelligence gathering
phase.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="pc-access">
<h3>PC Access<a class="headerlink" href="#pc-access" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>If physical access is granted to a PC, the penetration tester should be
able to attack the PC and gain access through multiple methods that
would allow access to the system.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="proximity-access-wifi">
<h2>Proximity Access (WiFi)<a class="headerlink" href="#proximity-access-wifi" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Wireless communications are an avenue for attacks to gain access through
RF type communications. The penetration tester should view the FCC radio
frequency list to see if the target has registered spectrum frequencies
in use.</p>
<div class="section" id="wifi-attacks">
<h3>WiFi Attacks<a class="headerlink" href="#wifi-attacks" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Regardless of protocol, there are a number of attacks available for WEP,
WPA, WPA2, EAP-FAST, EAP-LEAP, and other avenues. The attacker should be
familiar with the various encryption protocols and standards and be able
to effectively test the implementation around the controls put in place.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="attacking-the-user">
<h3>Attacking the User<a class="headerlink" href="#attacking-the-user" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Leveraging rogue access points in order to attack the victim is often a
beneficial and a viable attack method. Leveraging a rogue access point
to entice victims in order to leverage exploits or steal sensitive
information should be performed during a wireless assessment. There are
several common techniques in use of this, but most commonly the attacker
would setup a wireless access point with the same name or an enticing
name in order for the victim to connect.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="example-avenues-of-attack">
<h1>Example Avenues of Attack<a class="headerlink" href="#example-avenues-of-attack" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>In any scenario, the attacks should consist based on the scenario that
is within scope of the engagement. Below is a list of several attack
avenues to consider based on scenario but is by no means a comprehensive
list.</p>
<p>Web Application Attacks Social-Engineering Physical Attack Avenues
Memory Based Exploits (i.e. buffer/heap overflows, memory corruptions,
use-after-free). Man in the Middle VLAN Hopping USB/Flash Drive
deployment Reverse Engineering Zero-Day Angle Attacking the user
Encryption Cracking Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) Cracking Traffic
Analysis Firewire Routing protocols Phishing with Pretexting Employee
Impersonation</p>
<p>Again, these examples are only basic avenues for attack based on the
scenario you are performing for the organization. The value from a
penetration test comes from creativity and the ability to identify
exposures and exploit them in a precise manner.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="overall-objective">
<h1>Overall Objective<a class="headerlink" href="#overall-objective" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>In the pre-engagement interaction phase with the customer, a clear
definition of the overall objectives of the penetration test should have
been communicated. In the case of the exploitation phase, the biggest
challenge is identifying the least path of resistance into the
organization without detection and having the most impact on the
organizations ability to generate revenue.</p>
<p>By performing the prior phases properly, a clear understanding of how
the organization functions and makes money should be relatively
understood. From the exploitation phase and into the post-exploitation
phase, the attack vectors should rely solely on the mission of
circumventing security controls in order to represent how the
organization can suffer substantial losses through a targeted attack
against the organization.</p>
